            <p>My name is Habib Khan. I am a 33-year-old business professional currently working as the Director of Operations at Bad Wolf Technologies as well as operating my own company, Pulsar Group LLC.
            Since I joined Bad Wolf Technologies 5 years ago, I have helped grow the company from a few hundred thousand dollars per year to over $1.7 million in sales.
            Working closely with our engineering staff and implementing ideas from customers and other industry professional, I have helped develop new products with rugged specifications for the Military and Defense markets. </p>
            <p>I am currently looking to expand my knowledge base and skill set to develop and maintain websites. I would like to be able to create a website or application from scratch as well as integrate and update current web pages with new content and features. </p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy working on cars, hanging out with friends and family, atend shows and concerts, travel and enjoy different kinds of food. I enjoy meeting people from different walks of life and building relationships which otherwise go unnoticed. </p>
